Road infrastructure quality affects public safety, mobility, and long-term economic efficiency. When cracks, potholes, and surface deterioration go unnoticed, damage can grow into higher repair costs and hazardous road conditions. Municipal agencies must monitor large networks under changing lighting and weather, which makes timely coverage difficult. Computer vision can help, but field deployment remains limited by device resources and operational constraints. Manual surveys are still common, yet they are slow, inconsistent, and difficult to scale. Many automated approaches also rely on specialized sensors or cloud connectivity, which reduces accessibility for field teams. This leaves a practical gap: lightweight on-device systems are needed that connect detection with actionable reporting.

To address this gap, the thesis proposes an on-device road defect detection pipeline tailored to municipal reporting. The model is trained on the \gls{rdd2022} dataset, using 19,089 training images and 3,579 validation images across six defect classes. A \gls{yolov8s} architecture is selected to balance accuracy with mobile constraints. Training uses transfer learning from \gls{coco} weights, a 200-epoch schedule, and augmentations such as mosaic, mixup, and geometric transforms to improve robustness. The best checkpoint is selected using validation metrics and exported to \gls{coreml} for \gls{ios} deployment. A native \gls{swiftui} application runs real-time inference, stores detection history, and attaches \gls{gps} location to each detection. The app also includes a reporting module with authority contacts for 25+ countries, enabling direct field submission.

Results show a best \gls{map}@0.5 of 49.19\%, with precision of 60.43\% and recall of 47.22\% on the validation split. This performance is above typical baseline ranges for lightweight models and supports mobile feasibility. \gls{coreml} conversion preserves model behaviour while producing a deployable package for \gls{ios} devices. On iPhone 12+ hardware, inference runs in real time with sub-50 ms processing, enabling live inspection. The application provides immediate visual feedback, structured defect summaries, and location-aware reporting that reduces friction in maintenance workflows. Integrating detection with reporting improves response time and documentation consistency for municipal operations.


Overall, the thesis delivers a complete on-device detection and reporting system suited to practical road maintenance. It shows that a compact \gls{yolov8s} model can achieve field-ready accuracy while enabling actionable reporting through a mobile interface.
